### Starting the Project Up
Now that you have installed everything, you are now ready to spin up the development environment for the web portal. First, open the console/terminal on your computer and navigate to the project folder, if you are using VS Code or Atom, you can use their built in terminals as well. Then type in the following:

```
$ npm install
```
OR 

```
$ npm i
```
This command will install all of the dependencies listed in the package.json file at the root of this project.

Once 'npm i' finishes running, to start the development server run the following command in the terminal:

```
$ npm start
```

This command will start up the development server on [http://localhost:3000]. On this server, you can edit and run the entire website application from your local computer. All edits made to this src folder, upon being saved, will automatically reload the app to accommodate the changes you made.
